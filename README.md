# Idaho-River-Drag-TP-Sensors
The Idaho River Drag system is microcontroller based and can be used to collect atmospheric, surface, and submerged temperature and pressure data while the sensors are dragged through a stream.

The center for Ecohydraulics at the University of Idaho has an ongoing program to provide cost effective methods for collecting field data on streabed behavior.  The River Drag system is a microcontroller based device that can be used to collect streabed data at atmospheric, surface, and submerged points in an automatically timed mode, or manually, on demand.  The sensosrs and controls are connected to a pole, and dragged through a stream.  A controls housing, with OLED screen, provides live user feedback, and stores data for later retrieval via Wifi.

Temperature and depth profiles can be developed from the stored data.  While there are many data collection and retrieval ideas available in the literature, The River Drag system is a filed ready device that can be supplied or built from open-source documentation.  The River Drga system utilizes common IOT electronics, inexpensive mechanical components, and open-source control software.
